        Hi Everyone Welcome To My Website
    </h1>
    <p>
        <strong>1.What Is Space?:</strong>
Space is the region beyond the Earth's atmosphere where there is very little matter. It begins roughly 100 kilometers (62 miles) above Earth, at a boundary called the Kármán line.<br>

<strong>2. What’s in Space?:</strong>
    planets – Like Earth, Mars, Jupiter.

Stars – Massive balls of burning gases like our Sun.

Galaxies – Huge systems of stars, gas, and dust (e.g., the Milky Way).

Moons – Natural satellites orbiting planets.

Asteroids & Comets – Space rocks and icy bodies.

Black Holes – Extremely dense objects with strong gravitational pulls.

Nebulae – Clouds of gas and dust where stars are born.<br>

<strong>3. Is Space Really Empty?:</strong>
No. Space is a vacuum, meaning it has very little matter, but it's not completely empty. It contains:

Hydrogen and helium gas (in very low densities)

Cosmic rays (high-energy radiation)

Dark matter and dark energy (mysterious substances that make up most of the universe's mass and energy)<br>

<strong>4. Why Is Space Important?:</strong>
It holds the universe and everything in it.

It allows scientists to study the origin and evolution of galaxies and stars.

It’s where we may one day find other planets that can support life.

Understanding space helps us learn more about Earth and its place in the cosmos.<br>

<strong>5.What Are Conditions in Space Like?:</strong>
No air – You can't breathe.

No sound – Sound needs a medium, like air, to travel.

Extreme temperatures – Can go from freezing cold to scorching hot.

Microgravity – Objects float because of the lack of gravitational pull like on Earth.<br>

<strong>6. How Do We Explore Space?:</strong>
Telescopes – Like Hubble or the James Webb, which observe space from afar.

Satellites – Orbit Earth and other planets to collect data.

Spacecraft – Carry instruments or astronauts into space.

Rovers – Explore surfaces of other planets like Mars.

Human missions – Like Apollo moon landings or the International Space Station (ISS).
